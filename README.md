Instead of letting Github Pages build the Jekyll site I've had to push its static form manually. This is because the Rouge highlighter
doesn't seem to support highlighting assembly despite having a lexer for it. Instead I'm using Pygments which is not supported by
Github Pages anymore.

This blog is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with a modified [textlog](https://github.com/heiswayi/textlog) theme
by [Heiswayi Nrird](https://heiswayi.nrird.com/).
